# MongoDB Registration and Login System

A simple Python application using **MongoDB** for user registration and login functionality. This project demonstrates how to interact with a MongoDB database using **PyMongo** to store, retrieve, and validate user credentials.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Allows users to register by providing their first name, last name, username, and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in with their registered credentials.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores user data securely in a MongoDB collection.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- MongoDB
- PyMongo (Python MongoDB Driver)

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.7 or higher)
- MongoDB Server (locally installed or available via a cloud service)
- `pymongo` library

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mongodb-registration-login.git
cd mongodb-registration-login
```

### 2. Install Required Python Packages
```bash
python -m pip install pymongo
```

### 3. Ensure MongoDB is Running
Make sure your MongoDB server is up and running. By default, the script connects to `localhost:27017`. 

You can start MongoDB using:
```bash
mongod --dbpath /path/to/your/database
```

### 4. Run the Script
```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

### Registering a New User
1. Run the script: `python app.py`
2. Select the **Register** option by entering `1`.
3. Provide your **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Username**, and **Password**.
4. If registration is successful, you'll see a "Successfully registered" message.

### Logging in as an Existing User
1. Run the script: `python app.py`
2. Select the **Login** option by entering `2`.
3. Enter your registered **Username** and **Password**.
4. If credentials are correct, you'll be greeted with a welcome message displaying your first and last name.

## Code Overview
### Database Connection
The MongoDB connection is set up using the following:
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/'
client = MongoClient(uri)
database = client.get_database('testDB')
collection = database.get_collection('user')
```

### Registration Function
The `registration()` function collects user details and stores them in the MongoDB collection:
```python
def registration():
    firstname = input('Please enter your firstname: ')
    lastname = input('Please enter your lastname: ')
    username = input('Please create a username: ')
    password = input('Please create a password: ')
    query = {'firstname': firstname, 'lastname': lastname, 'username': username, 'password': password}
    results = collection.insert_one(query)
    if results:
        print('Successfully registered')
    else:
        print('Registration unsuccessful')
```

### Login Function
The `login()` function validates user credentials against the database:
```python
def login():
    while True:
        username = input('enter username: ')
        password = input('enter password: ')
        query = {'username': username, 'password': password}
        user = collection.find_one(query)
        if user:
            print(f'Welcome, {user["firstname"]} {user["lastname"]}')
            break
        else:
            print('Incorrect username or password')
```

## Known Issues
- Error handling can be improved to provide more user-friendly messages.
- Passwords are stored in plain text. For a production system, consider using password hashing (e.g., `bcrypt`).

## Future Enhancements
- Implement password hashing for improved security.
- Add email verification during registration.
- Integrate with a frontend UI for a better user experience.
